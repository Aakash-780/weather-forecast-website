# 🌤️ Weather Forecast Website

A simple **Weather Forecast Website** prototype that provides current weather information for any location.  
It fetches data from a free weather API and displays **temperature, humidity, wind speed**, and **general weather conditions**.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Since the API used is free, the data may not always be 100% accurate or up-to-date.  
> This project serves as a basic prototype to demonstrate weather forecast functionality.
